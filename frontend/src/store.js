/* This is part of the first step to setting up redux. Redux allows one to share data across components. It is a library that allows you to create a global memory for any component to access, as a temp store. For example, a button click triggers a fuction(action). The info is passed to a reducer who listens for a specific type of data they have been subscribed to, and the info is then written in a store. The data is then available to all components. */
/* The process is to create a store, create a reducer, write the actions and then hook up with components.  */
/* before creating store.js install in front end the following: npm i redux react-redux redux-devtools-extension redux-thunk (4 downloads) */
